# Open Bioinformatics Foundation affiliated and core project FAQ

## Q: How do I apply for OBF Affiliated Project status?

Assuming your project meets, or intends to soon meet, all of the requirements in
 our [affiliated project policy](obf-docs/Affiliated-Project-Policy.md), please
 email [SOME EMAIL ADDRESS] with the following details:

- URL of the project
- Contact information for the project maintainers
- Proof of compliance with Affiliate Status requirements where possible, e.g.
licence, code of conduct, etc. or plan to implement any missing requirements in the near future.

You can also feel free to drop us a line if you have questions about your
eligibility before applying.

## Q: Why apply for affiliate status? Are there benefits or obligations?

A: The **benefits** of affiliate status are access to umbrella
resources, including a community of active open source developers, the chance to
 mentor summer students under the Google Summer of Code program, and domain /
 site hosting resources.

 The **obligations** of affiliate status are few - primarily projects must
 remain active and maintain a good standing within the community, e.g. by
 enforcing their code of conduct if necessary.

## Q: Can I sign my project over to the OBF's ownership?

A: The OBF is primarily a home for projects that are actively maintained. If
you fear your project doesn't have enough community contributors we can share
a call for contributors within the OBF community, but the OBF does not provide
software maintenance services.
  
## Q: I'm interested in taking donations for my project, or I've recently received a grant. Can the OBF handle my cash flow?

A: The OBF does not provide financial management for its member projects. You
could try to apply for financial hosting / sponsorship with organisations such
[SPI](https://www.spi-inc.org/), [NumFocus](https://www.numfocus.org/), or [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/)
